> Directus Users are the individual accounts that let you authenticate into the API and App. Each user belongs to a Role
> which defines its granular Permissions.

To use the App or API, you'll need a valid Directus User. Each user is assigned to a [Role](/concepts/roles/) that
determines what they have access to see and do. This means that the experience of users may vary significantly depending
on their role's access. For example, while some users may see _all_ platform content, others may only see a smaller
subset of Modules, Collections, or Fields.

## User Fields

Directus ships with a basic set of user fields that are displayed on the User Detail pages. While these system fields
are required/locked, you can extend the Directus Users Collection with any number of custom fields to create a fully
tailored [User Directory](/concepts/application/#user-directory). To add fields within system collections, simply follow
the normal guide for [Creating a Field](/guides/fields/#creating-a-field).

Below are the system User fields included by default.
